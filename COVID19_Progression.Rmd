*Disclaimer: This very simple report was prepared by a bioinformatician with no experience in epidemiology or virology, and as such should be treated simply as an alternate viewpoint on the data, which I was simply unable to find elsewhere. Many other people exist with much greater expertise on this subject. However, I do hope this provides a useful perspective which is able to add constructively to the wider discussion. In addition, it should be noted that this is very much focussed on Australian data.*

Data for confirmed cases, recoveries and fatalities was primarily sourced from Johns Hopkins University (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/), using the datasets provided at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.
JHU data is updated every 24 hours at approximately 23:59(UTC), which is about 9:30AM in Adelaide.

Live hourly updates for Australia are available from https://covid-19-au.github.io/ for those who would like an up to the minute breakdown of confirmed cases.
Numbers used for generation of this page are updated periodically throughout the day using values provided by https://api.infotorch.org/api/covid19/totals/, [The Guardian](https://interactive.guim.co.uk/docsdata/1q5gdePANXci8enuiS4oHUJxcxC13d6bjMRSicakychE.json) and those at [www.health.gov.au](`r govUrl`).
The Australian numbers used below **`r ifelse(updateAU, "do contain**", "do not contain** any")` confirmed cases reported since the JHU dataset was updated.
`r ifelse(updateAU, glue("As of {format(Sys.time(), '%H:%M')}, {n} of 8 states/territories have released updated COVID-19 figures since the overnight JHU release."), "")`
The current Australia total is `r comma(sum(dplyr::filter(confirmed, date == max(date), Country == "Australia")$confirmed))` using these data sources, and any corrections to these will be made as soon as is possible. 

Population sizes were obtained from [2019 UN Estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)).
Given the disparity of infection within China, China was broken into Hubei Province and the rest of China, with Hong Kong and Taiwan already being considered as separate countries in all datasets.
Population estimates for Hubei Province were taken from the 2018 estimates given by [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/279013/population-in-china-by-region/) and this is likely to be a very slight underestimate.

Confirmed cases of COVID-19 as provided by the Chinese Government have been discussed elsewhere as unusual, and data appears potentially unreliable.
In this analysis, discussions regarding accurate Chinese reporting are not considered further and data is simply presented as supplied by JHU.

However, all countries are likely to contain many unreported cases given the incomplete testing regimes in place for most countries.
Similarly, reporting in many countries may have features that cause concerns regarding data integrity and this makes comparison across countries difficult.
Information on *recovered cases is also difficult to accurately obtain* due inconsistent methods for considering a case as recovered, and lack of reporting for these cases in many jurisdictions.

# International Data {.tabset}

```{r setThresholds}
startingPoint <- 4
minPop <- 4e6
```


For this section, most data is presented *relative to population size*.
Growth in infection rates is only shown after the point at which the cumulative confirmed infection rate breached `r startingPoint` confirmed cases / million.
This equates to about `r round(startingPoint*dplyr::filter(wikiPops, Country == "Australia")$Population / 1e6,0)` confirmed cases within Australia, and is broadly comparable to the "Days since passing 100 confirmed cases" commonly shown elsewhere.

## Table of Most Impacted Countries

Confirmed cases in this table are effectively the cumulative, confirmed incidence rate.
Recovered patients and those who have passed away are still included in these numbers.
At the time of report preparation, **the total number of confirmed cases, including all countries for which data has been made available, is `r  confirmed %>% group_by("Province/State", Country) %>% dplyr::filter(date == max(date)) %>% .[["confirmed"]] %>% sum() %>% comma()`.**

## Daily Increase Vs Confirmed Cases

An alternate viewpoint on the data is to remove time and inspect the relationship between the daily increase in cases and the total number of cases.
When this relationship ceases it's near linear relationship, this can be a sign the control measures have begun to take effect.
Whilst this relationship **appears to be breaking down for Australia**, the cases of Hong Kong, Singapore and Iran should be taken as cautionary notes, where after a brief respite the proportional relationship once again resumed.

```{r sma}
sma <- function(x, n = 7){
    
    if (length(x) < n) return(rep(NA, length(x)))
    ind <- vapply(seq(1, length(x) - (n - 1)), seq, numeric(n), length.out = n)
    c(
        rep(NA, n - 1),
        colMeans(matrix(x[ind], nrow = n), na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

All figures and tables presented here simply aim to show an alternative viewpoint on the data.
Every way to view COVID-19 data will mask important features, and the values shown here do not take into account vital factors such as population density, variability of infection across regions within countries, social culture and demographics.
Many countries may not be directly comparable for a combination of the above factors.
It is simply to view the data through the lens of a country's population size using a value which should be easily interpretable.

In the above plot:

- Only countries are shown where the infection rate has surpassed `r startingPoint` cases/million for more than `r minDays` days.
This choice seemed to be a useful way of enabling the comparison of COVID-19 progression across countries after scaling for population size
- Only South Korea,and China appear to have brought the virus under some level of control. The infection rate currently sits around `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "South Korea") %>% group_by(Country, date) %>% summarise(confirmed = sum(confirmed)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::slice(nrow(.)) %>% inner_join(wikiPops) %>% summarise(rate = sprintf("%.1f", 1e6*confirmed/Population)) %>% .[["rate"]]` per million for South Korea and `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "China (Hubei)") %>% group_by(Country, date) %>% summarise(confirmed = sum(confirmed)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::slice(nrow(.)) %>% inner_join(wikiPops) %>% summarise(rate = sprintf("%.1f", 1e6*confirmed/Population)) %>% .[["rate"]]` per million for Hubei Province. This can also be thought of as `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "South Korea") %>% group_by(Country, date) %>% summarise(confirmed = sum(confirmed)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::slice(nrow(.)) %>% inner_join(wikiPops) %>% summarise(prop  = percent(confirmed/Population, accuracy = 0.0001)) %>% .[["prop"]]` and `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "China (Hubei)") %>% group_by(Country, date) %>% summarise(confirmed = sum(confirmed)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::slice(nrow(.)) %>% inner_join(wikiPops) %>% summarise(prop  = percent(confirmed/Population, accuracy = 0.0001)) %>% .[["prop"]]` of the total populations respectively. Note that despite these apparently low percentages, the actual numbers of deaths and hospitalisations are extremely non-trivial and the real impacts of these numbers cannot be treated lightly.
- Japan's early measures also appear to be highly effective, however the recent growth in infections within Singapore and Hong Kong should serve as a caution
- US numbers may also be unreliable given the low rates of testing and numerous anecdotal stories of suspected infections

## Currently Active Infection Rates

As an alternative viewpoint, the numbers of recovered and deceased patients have been removed from the numbers of confirmed infections plot to provide an estimate of the **currently active infections**.
Importantly, information regarding recovered cases is likely to be *the least reliable of reported values* as many regions do not report updated numbers for several consecutive days.
Additionally many regions do not report recovered cases as the **criteria for considering a person to have recovered as currently unclear**.

## Dimensional Reduction

In order to summarise which countries are the most similar to each other, a Principal Component Analysis was performed.
This enables the multi-dimensional data of the above plots to summarised in two dimensions.
As missing data cannot be included in this analysis, several countries which are at earlier comparative time-points than Australia were omitted from this analysis.

cp3 <- glue(
  "*Dimensional reduction showing which countries infection rates are the most similar to each other __at the {nDays} day time point, after passing {startingPoint} confirmed cases/million__.
  This may or may not be indicative of future spread within the population.
  The value {nDays} days was simply chosen as this marks how long since Australia passed this threshold.
  Countries which have not progressed beyond {startingPoint} confirmed cases/million for {nDays} days or more are not shown.
  Countries with populations < {comma(minPop)} are also excluded.
  Clusters were generated using k-means, manually specifying k = {k} and are not definitive.
  Principal Component 1, on the x-axis, corresponds to the greatest source of variability within the data 
  ({pcPercent[['PC1']]}), and countries which appear near each other along this axis can be assumed to be showing similar growth in confirmed infection rates at this time point.
  Separation along the y-axis is less significant, but also worthy of note, as this represents {pcPercent[['PC2']]} of variability within the data.
  At this early point, Australia's cumulative, confirmed infection rate is diverging from the cluster of countries which have responded well and is becoming more similar to Israel, the UK and other poor responding countries.
  This is suggestive that the early measures instituted in Australia may have been inadequate.*"

# Fatality, Recovery and Active Infection Rates {.tabset}

All rates presented in this section do not take population size into account, but simply look at the rates of recovery and fatalities within each country's cohort.

## Summary of All Rates

```{r fr}
fr <- confirmed %>%
  inner_join(deaths) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  dplyr::filter(date == max(date)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarise(fr = sum(deaths) / sum(confirmed)) %>%
  .[["fr"]]
rr <- confirmed %>%
  group_by(Country, date) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(confirmed), sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  left_join(
    recovered %>% 
      group_by(Country, date) %>%
      summarise_at(vars(recovered), sum, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(date == max(date)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  summarise(rr = sum(recovered) / sum(confirmed)) %>%
  .[["rr"]]
```


Summarising all available data from all countries:

- __The current fatality rate from all confirmed cases is `r percent(fr, accuracy = 0.1)`.__
This may be a function of under-reporting of true cases and is *very likely to be an overestimate*.
- __The current recovery rate from all confirmed cases is `r percent(rr,accuracy = 0.1)`.__
Given the level of under-reporting this may also be highly inaccurate.
- At this point, __`r percent(1 - fr - rr, accuracy = 0.1)` of all confirmed infections are considered as 'active'.__

  Countries are only shown if data is available for more than {minDays} days since passing this threshold.
  The ratio of recoveries to fatalities is shown on the log~2~ scale, such that when fatalities outnumber recoveries, the colour become more red.
  Conversely if the recoveries outnumber the fatalities the colour will become more green.
  If these two numbers are approximately equal, the colour will be white.
  As the numbers are on the log~2~ scale, a ratio of 2, would indicate 2^2^ = 4 times the number of __recoveries to fatalities__.
  Similarly a ratio of -2 would indicate that fatalities outnumber recoveries by a factor of 2^2^ = 4.
  Ratios are only available once there is one or more confirmed recoveries in addition to one or more confirmed fatalities.*"
)
```


A time-course of the relationship between recoveries and fatalities is shown.
Series of days which extend deeply into the red may possibly indicate where medical facilities are overloaded.
However, it is possible that during these times more attention is focussed on keeping critically ill patients alive than confirming a recovery.
It should be noted that many of the countries which are deep into the red at the current time are **affluent Western countries**.
It is also worth noting that despite the high death toll in Italy, recoveries outnumber fatalities for the majority of this time-course.

Australian State populations were taken from the [ABS Website](http://stat.data.abs.gov.au/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ERP_QUARTERLY) and were accurate in Sept 2019.
The difference with previous estimates used above was within 0.04%, and as such no adjustments were made.

A series of complimentary charts regarding the spread of COVID-19 are available from [the ABC website](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-17/coronavirus-cases-data-reveals-how-covid-19-spreads-in-australia/12060704).

Australia's spread of the virus appears in the previous plots as marginally slower than many other countries, grouping together with countries such as Greece, Israel and the UK.

- This may be a reflection of Australian geography or our tendency to have large personal space requirements
- This may also be a reflection of the pre-emptive strategies already being taken by the population and government
- Despite the above, Australia is **still in an exponential growth phase**, however there are **early signs of the growth levelling out**. The contribution of the distortions caused by the Ruby Princess to this apparent levelling our is still unclear
- Using an estimated population size of `r comma(dplyr::filter(wikiPops, Country == "Australia")$Population)`, the total percentage of the Australian population *confirmed as infected* currently sits at `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "Australia") %>% group_by(Country, date) %>% summarise(confirmed = sum(confirmed)) %>% ungroup() %>% dplyr::slice(nrow(.)) %>% inner_join(wikiPops) %>% summarise(prop  = percent(confirmed/Population, accuracy = 0.001)) %>% .[["prop"]]`, or one person in every `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "Australia", date == max(date)) %>% .[["confirmed"]] %>% sum() %>% divide_by(dplyr::filter(wikiPops, Country == "Australia")$Population) %>% raise_to_power(-1) %>% round(0) %>% comma()`. 
<!-- - However, projecting forward using a 7 day lag as representative of the delay between contracting the virus and manifestation of symptoms, the number of people within Australia who are currently infected may be near `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "Australia", date == max(date)) %>% .[["confirmed"]] %>% sum() %>% multiply_by(4) %>% comma()`, which corresponds to `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "Australia", date == max(date)) %>% .[["confirmed"]] %>% sum() %>% multiply_by(4) %>% divide_by(dplyr::filter(wikiPops, Country == "Australia")$Population) %>% percent(accuracy = 0.001)` of the population, or one person in every `r confirmed %>% dplyr::filter(Country == "Australia", date == max(date)) %>% .[["confirmed"]] %>% sum() %>% multiply_by(4) %>% divide_by(dplyr::filter(wikiPops, Country == "Australia")$Population) %>% raise_to_power(-1) %>% round(0) %>% comma()` -->

Regression lines are shown for each state as solid lines.
The y-axis is on a logarithmic scale indicating exponential growth is occurring.
States are shown in order of the initial date they passed {minRate} cases/million.
Most states show a strong upward curve during the week following 19^th^ March, clearly showing the impact of the Ruby Princess, however the consistent deviation below regression lines for all states is strongly suggestive of a slowing in the recent infection rate.
The hypothetical growth in the infection rate without that event occurring is not calculated here, however it is clear that the spread of COVID-19 has not continued at the same pace after that event initially occurred.*

## Statistical Analysis of State-wise Infection Rates


```{r lm}
lm <- confirmed %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    Country == "Australia"
  ) %>%
  dplyr::rename(State = `Province/State`) %>%
  left_join(ausPops) %>%
  mutate(
    Rate = round(1e6*confirmed / Population, 2),
    Date = format.Date(date, "%d-%B")
  ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    !is.na(Population),
    Rate > minRate,
    date <= dt
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(confirmed)) %>%
  mutate(
    State = fct_inorder(State)
  ) %>%
  dplyr::rename(
    Confirmed = confirmed
  ) %>%
  arrange(State, Date) %>%
  distinct(State, Confirmed, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  with(
    lm(log10(Rate) ~ (State + date)^2)
  ) 
```


In order to test whether the infection rates are different between states, a linear regression model was fit.
$\log_{10}$(Cumulative Confirmed Infection Rate) was assigned as the response variable with predictor variables being the State and Date.
Each State was assigned its own intercept and slope by use of an interaction term (i.e. State:date).
Given the potentially larger slope in NSW, this state was set as the baseline, with each other slope (i.e. interaction term) being presented as the difference in slope between each state and NSW. 
In this way comparisons against NSW were performed, but no comparisons between other states were performed.

Differences in the State-level intercepts are not particularly relevant, apart from capturing the initial time at which cumulative confirmed infection rate exceeded `r minRate` cases / million.
Differences between State-level slopes and NSW however, are of great interest, and as such only the slopes are shown.
For NSW this captures the actual slope of the daily change in infection rate, whilst for all other States, this represents the difference between the daily change in infection rate for that State in comparison to NSW.
Only differences in slope with an Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05 are of particular interest.
For those States which appear to be of interest, a negative value indicates an infection rate increasing more slowly than NSW, whilst a positive value indicates the opposite.
If no difference is noted between any state and NSW, it can be considered that these states are all experiencing growth at a similar rate.
Currently, **the infection rate in most states is doubling every `r round(log(2, base = 10^coef(lm)["date"]), 1)` days.**

## Assessment of Testing Within Each State

```{r tested}
tested <- list.files("tested", pattern = "tsv", full.names = TRUE) %>%
  sort() %>%
  .[length(.)] %>%
  read_tsv()
```


```{r updateTested}
tested <- c(
  "New South Wales" = nswTests,
  "Queensland" = qldTests,
  "Victoria" = vicTests,
  "Western Australia" = waTests,
  "South Australia" = saTests,
  "Australian Capital Territory" = actTests,
  "Tasmania" = tasTests,
  "Northern Territory" = ntTests
) %>%
  enframe(
    name = "State", value = "Tested"
  ) %>%
  mutate(Tested = as.numeric(Tested)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Tested)) %>%
  bind_rows(tested) %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(Tested = max(Tested, na.rm = TRUE))
tested %>%
  write_tsv(
    glue(
      "tested/tested_{format(Sys.Date(), '%Y%m%d')}.tsv"
    )
  )
```


Testing numbers were initially sourced from manual inspection of individual press releases for [NSW](`r nswUrl`), [QLD](`r qldUrl`), [VIC](`r vicUrl`), [WA](`r waUrl`), [SA](`r saUrl`), [TAS](`r tasUrl`), [ACT](`r actUrl`) and the [NT](`r ntUrl`).
Updates on testing numbers beyond the initial values were performed automatically using the above code which probes each state's official releases for the latest values, and updates where found.
The number of tested individuals in each state was then assessed as a function of State population size.
All results are valid at the time of report generation.

```{r propTest}
tested %>%
  full_join(
    confirmed %>%
      dplyr::filter(
        date == max(date)
      ) %>%
      rename(
        State = `Province/State`
      )
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Tested = case_when(
      is.na(Tested) ~ confirmed,
      Tested < confirmed ~ confirmed,
      !is.na(Tested) ~ Tested
    )
  ) %>%
  left_join(ausPops) %>%
  bind_rows(
    tibble(
      State = "Total",
      Population = sum(.$Population, na.rm = TRUE),
      confirmed = sum(.$confirmed, na.rm = TRUE),
      Tested = sum(.$Tested, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  ) %>%

    `Percent Tested` = Tested / Population,
    Positive = confirmed / Tested,
    Negative = 1 - Positive,
    isTotal = grepl("Total", State)
  ) %>%

    State, Population,
    Confirmed = confirmed,
